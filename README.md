Welcome to the **Advanced Android Learning Repository**! 
This project is part of my journey to master advanced Android development concepts. The application showcases various lessons, each accessible through dedicated buttons on the main screen. As I progress through my course, I'll keep adding new lessons here.

You can refer to [NotesPage](https://github.com/Loperdax/Android-Learning-Procjects/blob/master/Notes.md) for more access to the notes
